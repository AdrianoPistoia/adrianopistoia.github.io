                    <!-- <p>Of course, videogames is just an excuse to learn all about programming, like <span class="boldenThis">Data Structure, UI/X, Animation, Optimization, Debugging</span></br>This made me a good all-rounder!</p> -->

                    <p>On our ninth birthday, my twin and i got a<span class="boldenThis"> Play Station </span> that day, <span class="boldenThis">the coals</span> heated by previous curiousity, <span class="boldenThis">where turned bright red in an instant</span>, i wanted to explore all of this worlds!</p>
                    <p><span class="boldenThis">Then and there i decided i was going to study everything i could to make all the games i want</span>, from cooking to combat, story-telling to math and physics...</p>
                    <p> <span class="boldenThis"> And here i am</span>, completely in love with all these digital worlds we, developers, can create, and so, <span class="boldenThis">make other people feel like i felt when i was a kid</span>.</p> -->
