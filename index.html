                    <p><span class="boldenThis">  Growing up, i was a really curious kid</span> filled with questions, luckily for me, my father answered all of them with long physics explanations or his own experiences.</p>
                    <p>On our ninth birthday, <span class="boldenThis">my twin and i got a Play Station</span>, when i played some games, <class="boldenThis">i got fascinated, it was a whole new world</span> inside a little box!</p>
                    <p>That day, <span class="boldenThis">the coals</span> heated by previous curiousity, <span class="boldenThis">where turned bright red in an instant</span>, i wanted to explore all of this worlds!</p>
                    <p>But then the three games we played got old, and i asked my father how are games made, my father told me <span class="boldenThis">software developers</span> made them...</p>
                    <p><span class="boldenThis">Then and there i decided i was going to study everything i could to make all the games i want</span>, from cooking to combat, story-telling to math and physics...</p>
                    <p>And here i am, completely in love with all these digital worlds we, developers, can create, and so, <span class="boldenThis">make other people feel like i felt when i was a kid</span>.</p>
